Reading the Twitters the other day, someone mentioned (sorry, should have starred it) that when they are looking at resumes they are less interested in what you've done at work or at school and are way more interested in what you did last weekend.  What you do in your spare time shows what you're really passionate about.

Now that I think about it, I think it was [zefrank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9RN-Uf1rBY "zefrank, Thoughts on the Creative Career").

Anyway it got me thinking about what I actually do on weekends.  My first thought after watching that video was of course, "Oh my goodness, I don't code nearly enough on the weekends!  People are going to think that I don't care enough about code and design!  I need to get some projects started, redesign the website, run some experiments, code code code!"  Then I remembered that, "No, I have a daughter and it's her birthday this weekend and your job is to celebrate it."

Then I realized that I actually do a lot of diverse things on the weekend. Sometimes I code.  Sometimes I spend time with my family and friends.  Sometimes I write or play video games or read or make a new recipe.  But unfortunately, sometimes I just sit around too. 

So then I thought, "I should make a website to encourage myself not to do that last thing."  [So I did.](http://dansweekend.tumblr.com/ "Dansweekend.tumblr.com")
