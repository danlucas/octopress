Just out of curiosity I wanted to know if I could manipulate text using just HTML and CSS3. More than just change size or line-height, I want to actually show hide inline text.

But first I just want to try embedding [codepen.io](http://codepen.io) in this new blog:

<pre class="codepen" data-height="300" data-type="result" data-href="lzvbq" data-user="danlucas" data-safe="true"><code></code></pre>
<script async src="http://codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Well that was ridiculously easy. See the full [codepen here](http://codepen.io/danlucas/full/lzvbq).

For right now I'm just changing the text to use initials instead of the full name once the space gets under 600px. Updates as I figure out more.
