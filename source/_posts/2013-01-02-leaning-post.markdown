This post is named “Leaning Post”, because I was going to call it “Learning Post” but made a typo. Then I just left it like that because I like the sound of a leaning post. A place you can just lean on for a little while in middle of or after work. Just to get set your mind at ease for even a few seconds.

Of course this site is not for that at all. This is supposed to be a portfolio / library / playground / blog thing where I keep my thoughts and the things I’m working on organized. It’s a living site, one where I update not just posts, but the design, the features, and the content as well. I’ve got some ideas and I hope to bring you with me through the process.

But Leaning Post is a nice thought. I want a leaning post. Maybe I’ll put one up here too.
