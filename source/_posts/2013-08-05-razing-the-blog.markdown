Not really.

I'm starting a new project to create a new blog using different technology.  Octopress and Jekyll are awesome but I need the practice.  

So here's what we're going to do. 

* New personal space set up at [github]('http://danlucas.github.io')
* Adding a new category the rebuild and give it top billing in the navigation
* Simplification the design of this blog, because why not?

I'm keeping all the updates public, and you'll be able to follow them here, but I'll probably deemphasize them on the page so they don't get in the way of the more general posts.

Wish me luck.  (Turns on bulldozer...)
